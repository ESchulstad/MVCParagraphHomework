# MVCParagraphHomework

The PureWow website is a blog featuring different articles pertaining to life, food recipes, and other similar topics. MVC could be implemented into this site so viewers could create an account and login in order to save articles to read later or create a list of favorites so that they can always find their favorite articles from the site in one place. This would require a database that stores not only the users account information, but also one to save the articles that they put into their lists so nothing is lost and the user can easily find them.
